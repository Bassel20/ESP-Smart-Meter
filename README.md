# ESP-Smart-Meter
Our project for detecting electricity theft using AI and IoT with smart meters began with the design and implementation of a power measuring unit. The unit consisted of a controller with a Wi-Fi module, AC sensors, and voltage sensors to allow real-time monitoring of the electricity usage data.
